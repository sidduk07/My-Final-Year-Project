**Description:**

Flappy Bird Game is a classic arcade game developed using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. This project was created as a part of my final year project. The game features a bird that the player controls by tapping the spacebar, making the bird navigate through pipes without colliding.

**Features:**

- **Responsive Controls:** The game responds to spacebar presses, allowing the player to control the bird's flight.
  
- **Scoring System:** Players earn points by successfully passing through pipes. The score is displayed on the screen and saved for tracking the player's progress.

- **Difficulty Levels:** The game offers different difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) that affect the speed and complexity of the gameplay.

- **Pause Functionality:** Players can pause the game at any time by pressing 'P', and resume by pressing 'C'.

- **End Screen:** When the game ends, an end screen displays the player's score and options to return to the main menu, restart the game, or quit.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Python:** The game logic and functionality are implemented in Python programming language.

- **Pygame:** Pygame, a popular Python library, is used for game development. It provides modules for you to access the video display, play sounds, and handle user input.

**How to Play:**

1. **Run the Game:** Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

2. **Game Controls:**
   - Press the spacebar to make the bird flap and ascend.
   - Press 'P' to pause the game.
   - Press 'C' to continue the game from the pause state.
   - Press 'Q' to quit the game.

3. **Objective:** Navigate the bird through the pipes without colliding. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns you a point.
